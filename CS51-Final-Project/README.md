## CS51 Final Project



This repository contains my final project for Harvard's
CS 51 class, Abstraction and Design in Computation.

It implements a small subset of an OCaml-like language
using the skills of design, abstraction, testing, and
debugging that Iâ€™ve learned during the course. This language
is Turing-complete and referred to as "MiniML".
