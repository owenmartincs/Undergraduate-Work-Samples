			<p id="aboutMeP">Hi! My name is Owen Martin, and this is my digital portfolio.<br><br>
			I am currently a graduate of Rogers High School in Newport, Rhode Island. While I would consider myself a scientist by nature, I participate in many areas outside of academics. Some of my interests include playing the violin, swimming competitively and dancing classical ballet. This portfolio is intended to showcase my high school achievements in the field of computer science.<br><br>
			As of August 2018, I will be attending Harvard University. If you would like to view a copy of my old r&eacute;sum&eacute;, please click <a class="pLink" href="Resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
			Thanks for exploring my portfolio!</p>
