## HTML/CSS Work Sample: Digital Portfolio (2018)



This repository contains an old digital portfolio that showcases my high school
achievements in computer science.

It is written in HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, and implements a website containing
work samples from my high school CS courses, namely AP Computer Science and
the unique Academy of Information Technology (AOIT) course series.

As of 21 September 2022, the website can be viewed at
