## HTML/CSS Work Sample: Digital Portfolio



This repository contains an old digital portfolio that showcases my high school
achievements in computer science. Last updated in 2018, this website is an
outdated but sufficient demonstratration of my skills in web
design.

In HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, it implements a simple website containing
work samples from my high school CS courses, namely AP Computer Science and
the unique Academy of Information Technology (AOIT) course series.

As of 21 September 2022, the website is hosted and can be viewed at
