## HTML/CSS Work Sample: Digital Portfolio



This repository contains an old digital portfolio that showcases my high school
achievements in computer science.

In HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, it implements a simple website containing
work samples from my high school CS courses, namely AP Computer Science and
the unique Academy of Information Technology (AOIT) course series.

As of 21 September 2022, the website can be viewed (without my profile image, unfortunately) at
