
## Java Work Sample: AP Computer Science (2017)



This repository contains an exercise from my high school
AP Computer Science course.

Written in Java, it implements a simple object-oriented program that
uses encapsulation, class interaction, and polymorphism to
render a train composed of various car classes. As of 21 September
2022, the rendering method employs depreciated Java features; an
earlier version is needed to run the program.
