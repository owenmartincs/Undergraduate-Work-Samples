
## JavaScript Work Sample: Holiday Game (2016)



This repository contains a simple holiday game I made
during one of my high school computer science courses, Academy of
Information Technology II.

Written in Javascript, it implements a 2D snowman that can be controlled
by the player's left and right arrow keys. The snowman collects
falling snowflakes and recieves decorative rewards at 50, 100, and 150
snowflakes collected. The game can be launched by cloning the
directory and opening the index.html file.
