
## JavaScript Work Sample: Holiday Game



This repository contains a simple holiday game I made back in 2016
during one of my high school computer science courses, Academy of
Information Technology II.

Using Javascript, it implements a 2D snowman controlled by the
player's left and right arrow keys. The snowman will collect
falling snowflakes and recieve decorations at 50, 100, and 150
snowflakes collected.

Due to an old bug in the code, the snowflakes will spawn in the
same horizontal position if the snowman collects them before they
reach the ground. Thus, keeping the snowman still is actually the
fastest way to recieve each decoration.

The game can be launched by cloning the directory and opening the
index.html file.
