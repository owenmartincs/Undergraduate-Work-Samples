## OCaml Work Sample: User-Defined Turing-Complete Language



This repository contains my final project for Harvard's
CS 51 class, Abstraction and Design in Computation.

Using OCaml, it implements a small subset of an OCaml-like language
using the skills of design, abstraction, testing, and
debugging taught during the course. The implemented language
is Turing-complete and referred to as "MiniML".
