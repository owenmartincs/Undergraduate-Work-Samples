
## Python Work Sample: Stellar Orbit Simulation



This repository contains a Python notebook I created
during my time with Dr. Jo√£o Alves at the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University.

Run in Google Colab, it requests read and write
permission to the researcher's Google Drive data
directory so that they can perform simulations of
stellar orbits entirely in the cloud.
